# Build an app for public health
The "Sant√© publique France" agency has launched a call for projects to find innovative ideas for food-related applications. 
You want to participate and propose an idea for an application.

The Open Food Facts dataset is available on the official website https://world.openfoodfacts.org/. The variables are defined at 
this address: https://world.openfoodfacts.org/data/data-fields.txt

The fields are separated into four sections:

- General information on the product sheet: name, date of modification, etc.
- A set of tags: product category, location, origin, etc.
- The ingredients making up the products and their possible additives.
- Nutritional information: quantity in grams of a nutrient per 100 grams of the product.

## Your mission
After reading the call for projects, here are the different stages that you have identified:

1) Process the dataset, by:

- Brainstorming an app idea.
- Identifying relevant variables for future processing, and necessary for your application idea.
Cleansing data by:
- highlighting any missing values, with at least 3 processing methods adapted to the variables concerned,
 identifying and quantifying possible outliers for each variable.
- Automating these treatments to avoid repeating these operations

2) Throughout the analysis, produce visualizations to better understand the data. Perform a univariate analysis for each variable of interest, 
in order to synthesize its behavior.

3) Confirm or refute the hypotheses using a multivariate analysis. Perform the appropriate statistical tests to verify the significance of the results.

4) Justify your application idea. Identify arguments justifying the feasibility (or not) of the application based on Open Food Facts data.

5) Write an exploration report and pitch your idea during the defense of the project.
